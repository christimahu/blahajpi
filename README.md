## 💜 What is Blahaj PI? 💜

Blahaj PI (Private Investigator) is a protective blue shark 🦈 who swims through social media to identify potentially harmful content targeting transgender and non-binary individuals. In these challenging times, when our community faces increasing hostility, Blahaj is here to help create safer online spaces. 

Just like the cuddly IKEA shark that has become a beloved symbol in our community, Blahaj PI offers comfort through protection - standing guard against bullying, harassment, and harmful rhetoric while you navigate online spaces.

**Currently in development:** While our ultimate goal is to scan live social media, this initial MVP version only analyzes the included example dataset. Future versions will support processing content from specific social media accounts and additional data formats.

## ✨ Features ✨

- 🧠 **Sentiment Analysis:** Identifies potentially harmful content with machine learning
- 📊 **Content Classification:** Labels text as "Safe" or "Harmful" with confidence scores
- 📝 **Detailed Explanations:** Provides reasoning behind classifications
- 📈 **Visualization Tools:** Generates word clouds to understand content patterns
- 🧮 **Batch Processing:** Analyzes multiple files for efficient processing
- ⚙️  **Configurable Models:** Different configurations for speed, accuracy, or balanced performance
- 🔧 **Command Line Interface:** Easy to use for both beginners and experts
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensures reliable and secure performance

## 📋 Getting Started 📋

### Prerequisites

- C++23 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.14 or higher
- Python 3.6+ (for build scripts)
- Google Test (for running tests)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/christimahu/blahajpi.git
   cd blahajpi
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   # Using the development script (recommended)
   ./dev.py --build

   # Or manually with CMake
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

## 💫 Quick Start with Demo 💫

For a guided tour of all features, simply run:

```bash
./dev.py --demo
```

This will:
1. Clean any previous builds and results
2. Build the project if needed (including running tests)
3. Train a model using example data
4. Demonstrate text analysis
5. Show visualization capabilities
6. Explain configuration options

The demo is perfect for first-time users or when showcasing the tool to others!

## 🚀 Full Tutorial: Using Blahaj PI 🚀

### Step 1: Build the Project 🔨

First, we need to build Blahaj PI:

```bash
./dev.py --build
```

This compiles the C++ code and creates the executable in the `build/bin` directory. Tests run automatically during build to ensure everything works correctly.

### Step 2: Testing 🧪

Though the build runs tests and stops on test failure, you may want to get deeply familiar with the tests as a means of learning about the codebase. Here are a few tests to try:

```bash
# Run the text processor tests to understand how preprocessing works
./dev.py --test --filter=text_processor_test

# Run sentiment analysis tests to see expected behaviors
./dev.py --test --filter=analyzer_test

# Run security tests to understand safety measures
./dev.py --test --filter=security_test
```

These tests showcase core functionality and can help you understand how the components work together.

### Step 3: Train Your Shark Detective 🦈🎓

Before Blahaj can analyze text, it needs training on what harmful content looks like:

```bash
# Using the provided example data
./dev.py --run -- train --dataset data/examples/twitter_example.csv --output models/my_model
```

This trains a machine learning model using labeled examples from the included sample dataset:
- `0` in the dataset represents safe content
- `4` represents potentially harmful content

The model learns patterns associated with each category and saves the trained model to the specified location.

### Step 4: Analyze Text 🔍

Now Blahaj is ready to analyze text from the example dataset:

```bash
# Analyze the sample dataset
./dev.py --run -- analyze --file data/examples/twitter_example.csv
```

Blahaj will analyze the content and tell you whether it appears harmful or safe, along with a confidence score and explanation. Results are stored in the `results` directory at the project root.

### Step 5: Visualize Results 📊

Generate visualizations to understand patterns in analyzed content:

```bash
./dev.py --run -- visualize --input data/examples/twitter_example.csv --output results/visualization.txt
```

This creates a word cloud showing the most frequent terms in the analyzed content, helping you identify patterns of harmful language.

### Step 6: Batch Processing 📚

For demonstration purposes, you can see how batch processing would work:

```bash
./dev.py --run -- batch --input-dir data/examples
```

This processes all files in the example directory and provides a summary report.

## 🧪 Testing Blahaj PI 🧪

We take testing seriously to ensure Blahaj PI is both accurate and secure:

```bash
# Run all tests
./dev.py --test

# Run only unit tests
./dev.py --test --unit

# Run only integration tests
./dev.py --test --integration

# Run with security sanitizers
./dev.py --run-asan  # Address Sanitizer
./dev.py --run-ubsan  # Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
```

Our testing suite includes:
- Unit tests for all components with Google Test
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for workflow validation
- Security tests to ensure data safety
- Fuzz testing to verify robustness against unexpected inputs

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing documentation.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options ⚙️

Blahaj PI comes with several configuration presets in the `configs/` directory:

- `default.conf`: Balanced settings for general use
- `fast_model.conf`: Optimized for speed (when you need quick results)
- `accurate_model.conf`: Optimized for maximum accuracy (when precision matters most)
- `production_model.conf`: Balanced for deployment environments

To use a specific configuration:

```bash
./dev.py --run -- --config configs/fast_model.conf analyze --file data/examples/twitter_example.csv
```

## 🔧 Command Reference 🔧

## 🦈 Why "Blahaj PI"? 🦈

The name combines two significant elements:

1. **Blahaj** (pronounced "blah-haj") is the name of IKEA's blue shark plush toy that has become a beloved symbol in the trans community - offering comfort, support, and a sense of safety.

2. **PI** stands for "Private Investigator" - like the detective shark on our logo, complete with magnifying glass and trenchcoat, investigating to keep online spaces safe.

Together, they represent our mission: a friendly guardian helping to create safer spaces online for trans and non-binary individuals. 🏳️‍⚧️
